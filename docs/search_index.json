Photogrammetry has been used to model small historical artifacts, structures, and topography. Drones have become an important tool in photogrammetry and topographic modeling in recent years as the combination of these tools provides a relatively cheap alternative to LiDAR when characterizing specific sites. Topographic modeling is useful in multiple fields, and is becoming more widely used in water resources. One specific type of topographic modeling is bathymetry mapping. Bathymetry mapping is topographic modeling of the floor of oceans, seas, lakes, and reservoirs. Bathymetry mapping at reservoirs is usually accomplished through the use of sonar technology, but if the site is not inundated photogrammetry can be used to model the floor of a reservoir. Sonar cannot record the shallower depths of a reservoir and most reservoirs are not at full pool year-round. Since reservoirs are not always at full pool and shallower depths cannot be modeled via sonar some data is missing and a full pool bathymetric map cannot be created. A photogrammetry survey using drones could “finish” the sonar data by modeling the shoreline. This book will test the efficacy of shoreline modeling and the issues associated with modeling shorelines using photogrammetry and drones. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Literature", " Chapter 2 Literature Photogrammetry is an accurate and useful method for generating topographic models. In recent years, Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms have used imagery from small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) to generate accurate topographical models. This is a more cost-effective method for generating topography for small areas compared to traditional aerial photogrammetric methods. Extending these general terrain models, recent studies have demonstrated the use of sUAVs and SfM technology in the field of water resources [1-8]. The majority of this work revolves around using UAVs data collection methods to create accurate three-dimensional (3D) topographic models. For example, researchers have monitored braided river channels using photogrammetry [5] and sUAV images have been used to capture detailed orthoimages of river streambeds and process these images to accurately estimate the particle size distribution of streambed sediments [6]. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has been used in conjunction with sUAV technology to create topo-bathymetric models [9]. LiDAR is a tool that could be used in place of SfM photogrammetry to model shorelines, although LiDAR surveys tend to be more costly as they generally require larger UAVs and more costly sensors. SfM-based photogrammetry has been used to supplement standard sonar collections by collecting data in shallow depths that sonar technology cannot accurately model [1]; our method extends this research to above-water areas. Others have used sUAV-based methods to monitor changes in coastline due to wave runup [2] and evaluate water resource infrastructure such as spillways [10]. Most sUAV based surveys use a pre-determined grid format for flight patterns over areas where the width and length are of similar magnitude, thus most of the current literature on ground control point spacing discuss and address a grid format for flight patterns and ground control (GCP) placement [11,12]. Ground control points are targets set out with known GPS locations before the flight of the UAV that then tie a photogrammetry model (point cloud model) to reality. Although gridded flights are most common for collecting over typical sites, some jobs require long, thin flight paths such as the bathymetric surveys discussed in my project, roads, road cut slopes, levees, or canals [13]. The issue of GCP spacing and orientation along long corridors has been research with details of the expected accuracy with different GCP spacing and orientation along a relatively long stretch of road reported [14]. My project deals with a similar flight pattern to that presented here, but roads generally follow a regular line, without significant changes, while some reservoir shorelines are erratic and have a more fractal geometry. Long, erratic, shorelines also pose an issue during fieldwork as placing many GCPs may be unrealistic, time consuming, or costly as parts of the shoreline could be inaccessible. The minimal need of GCPs has been researched. The current literature on the precision of point cloud models based on GCP spacing suggests that horizontal (X-, Y-) accuracy is more easily achieved than vertical (Z-) accuracy [15]. Vertical (Z-) accuracy is of the utmost important when creating bathymetric maps as storage capacity curves rely on volumetric calculations of the calculated point cloud, thus my project will look into the precision in the X-, Y-and Z-direction of point clouds produced with varying amounts of GCPs along a shoreline, with a special emphasis on the Z-direction precision. Other factors will be tested to find how those factors effect the shoreline model. Alvarez, L.V.; Moreno, H.A.; Segales, A.R.; Pham, T.G.; Pillar-Little, E.A.; Chilson, P.B.

The lidR package allows for the plotting and analysis of an .las point cloud file. This file is a collection of 3-D coordinate points. The number of points in an .las photogrammetry file usually has more than a million points. The code shown below summarizes the control point cloud that will be used as a reference as it provides the best physical representation of Newcastle Dam that we could produce. We then tested different factors and observed the visual and statistical differences between the point cloud models to determine which factors are important in creating an accurate shoreline model. The test datasets and their information are shown below the control dataset (I am currently working to simplify all the datasets as my computer crashes when I try to process more than just the control cloud when I build the book). 3.1 Control Dataset library(lidR) las &lt;- readLAS(&quot;2-18-20-Correct.las&quot;) Zdata &lt;- las@data[[&quot;Z&quot;]] Xdata &lt;- las@data[[&quot;X&quot;]] Ydata &lt;- las@data[[&quot;Y&quot;]] boxplot(Zdata) boxplot(Xdata) boxplot(Ydata) 3.2 Test Datasets "],
